  <p>I invite you to embark on a journey into the fascinating world of microwave and millimeter-wave signal propagation, where I dedicate my research to exploring the intricate interplay between weather phenomena and wireless communication. As a Master's degree candidate in Information and Communication Engineering at the esteemed School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, I am passionate about harnessing the power of explainable deep learning to unlock the secrets of weather's impact on these crucial communication bands.

   My research delves into the analysis of time-series data with <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>, seeking to understand and predict how weather elements like <strong>Rain</strong>, <strong>Temperature</strong>, <strong>Humidity</strong>, <strong>Cloud cover</strong>, and <strong>Fog</strong> affects signal propagation in the higher frequency band such as mmWave band. Through the meticulous integration of diverse weather and climate data from sources like <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/tools-and-resources/weather-and-climate-resources">NOAA.GOV</a>, <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/study-groups/rsg3/Pages/dtbank-dbsg3.aspx">ITUdatabanks</a>, <a href="https://chrs.web.uci.edu/">CHRS</a>, local weather stations, radio wave propagation measurement centers, and more, I strive to paint a comprehensive picture of this complex interplay. 
            
  My master's degree thesis titled as <strong>Deep Learning Based Rain Attenuation Prediction Modeling for Microwave and mmWave Band</strong> is one of the research works that I am exploring, currently investigating in collaboration with the supervision of my academic advisor <a href="https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/eie/8077.html">Prof. Xiong Lei</a>. The above mentioned data sources are the main data sources of this research. 
            
  But my academic journey extends beyond this primary focus. My keen interest in satellite communication, remote sensing, and the application of information and communication engineering in diverse fields fuels my exploration into these realms as well. Whether it's unraveling the mysteries of cloud and precipitation measurements from satellites or pushing the boundaries of Beidou technology, my passion for knowledge knows no bounds.</p>
  <h2 style="color: green; font-size: 2em;">My achievements serve as testaments to my dedication to excellence</h2>
  <strong style="color: green; font-size: 1em;">A. ALX Full Stack Software Engineering </strong>
  <p>Successfully graduated from the rigorous ALX Full Stack Software Engineering Training Course, equipping myself with invaluable skills that enhance my research capabilities. This immersive experience not only enhanced my software acumen but also amplified my programming prowess, profoundly elevating my capabilities in the realm of research. The enriching details of this program can be discovered here.</p>
  <strong style="color: green; font-size: 1em;">B. International Training Workshop </strong>
  <p>Earned a certificate of completion from the 2023 International Training Workshop on Beidou Technology and Its Application in the Belt and Road Countries and Regions solidifying my understanding of GNSS, specifically <a href="http://en.beidou.gov.cn/SYSTEMS/System/">BeiDou Navigation Satellite System</a> technology. This training workshop not only have solidified my understanding about satellite navigation system but also have impacted my research interest twoward this technology. Since then, I am quite impressed with the cutting edge technology in this field and it jas become my priority to embark myself in as a young research talent. </p>
  <p>As I navigate the exciting and challenging landscape of academic research, I remain committed to rigor, integrity, and collaboration. I welcome fellow researchers and individuals with shared interests to explore my website, engage in discussions, and join me on this intellectual quest.</p>
 <h3 style="color: green; font-size: 2em;">Prepare to be captivated by the hidden wonders of wireless communication!</h3>
